## Introduction

If you’ve never played Mastermind, it’s a game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns (like hangman with colored pegs). Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space.

### Assignment

Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computer’s random code.

## Post-project Review

For the interest of time, I want to move forward with the course. The base game works in accordance to the rules of Mastermind.

## Brainstorming

Classes
1. Game class
    - Handles overall game state
    - Print methods for game status
2. Board class
    - Tracks board state
    - Print methods for board
3. Player class?
    1. Human
    2. Computer

I'm not 100% sure if I'll need a player class this time. Guess it'll depend on how big the game class gets.
