## Post-project Review

For the interest of time, I want to move forward with the course. The base game works in accordance to the rules of Mastermind.

## Brainstorming

Classes
1. Game class
    - Handles overall game state
    - Print methods for game status
2. Board class
    - Tracks board state
    - Print methods for board
3. Player class?
    1. Human
    2. Computer

I'm not 100% sure if I'll need a player class this time. Guess it'll depend on how big the game class gets.
